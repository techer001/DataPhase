    <h5>Help</h5>
      <p>This your help page. this page page contains a way to contact me as contains the information about contributors will be listed. This should also turn into a drop down box with links to other pages from the box.</p>
      
  <br />

      <p>Credit for the artwork/logo goes to Kevin Pettigrew (do a name check before finals). All Java scripts were gotten from the internet. Appropiate mentions are under the "js" folder in thier respective files.</p>

  <br />

      <p>Any suggetions, concerns, or issues should be addressed in the drop down menu with some contact forms. This is fun text. There should be a lot of other stuff here that I should probably come up with. Also, once the drop down menu is created, all of this content should be deleted and this file used as the draft for the new pages so that I can just copy for each new page needed.</p>
